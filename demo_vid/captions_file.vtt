Hello, this is the demonstration video on our project for visualizing congressional trading data

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.000
So on our Github page under the visualizations section you'll see 3 main charts.

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:26.000
The most important view being this tree map on the top of the assets most largely traded by members of Congress in terms of volume dollar volume of trades.

4
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.000
So the largest you'll see on the left by hovering over is Microsoft, followed by Apple and Tesla.

5
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:42.000
If you've been following these with all you know they are 3 of the largest companies in the world, and have been extremely lucrative to invest in over the last couple of years, 

6
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.500
these 2 charts at the bottom show data currently representative of our entire data set.

7
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:59.000
The first being the 5 members of Congress, with the most trading activity over the course of our data set with their color representing their political affiliation.

8
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.000
And we also have on the right the trading volume of all of Congress over the course of our data set.

9
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
and again, you can hover over any point to see how much money was traded on that day.

10
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.000
clicking on a box on the tree map will filter these bottom two charts to that specific security

11
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.000
So if we look at apple, we can see, for example, Nancy Pelosi has traded the most $Apple at this time 

12
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:40.000
and the largest trades were in April, July and October of 2020 and this can be done for any stock you see up here on this tree map. Thank you
