      Abstract
    </h1>

    <p>
      This data visualization project deals with the controversy over stock trading in Congress which has been a hot topic over the past year or so. Members of Congress are required to publicly disclose any trades they make so as to not violate insider trading laws. However, much of this data is not easily readable by the average retail investor. The goal of the project is to present this information in the most transparent way possible to retail investors.

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>The following is tentative and will be reworded before our final submission</strong> Our final visualization will be a dashboard that gives the most relevant information to understand trading done by members of Congress. The primary overview will be given through a tree map of Congress’s largest holdings. Tree maps are generally used to display information about a grouping of stocks – mainly their weight and recent performance. Weight is represented by box size and performance is shown through color (red/green). These channels will be important for displaying what is unique about Congress’s holdings. This will allow the user to see abnormal over-weighting in stocks which have significantly outperformed over recent years, as well as a general pattern of positive performance from stocks held by Congressmembers. Another important note on this chart is that it will be used to filter other charts in the dashboard. This means that selecting a stock from the tree map will adjust the other charts to only display data for the selected stock. Allowing this selection to be made will allow the user to investigate individual securities and better understand how members of Congress invest.
    The next chart a user will see – and the other chart currently made statically in our GitHub page – is a horizontal bar chart of the most prolific traders within Congress. The “Top Traders” chart is a relatively simple concept but satisfies the important need of identifying which elected officials are the most active in financial markets. It may be shocking for a user to see just how much wealth that some Congress members (who have salaries below $200,000) such as Rick Scott and  Nancy Pelosi have over $100 million of net worth, much of which is actively traded. Once again, the contents of this chart will be filtered based on the selections made in the tree map. Selecting $AAPL in the first visualization will display which members of Congress have traded the most Apple stock. 
    Another chart that will change in parallel to the “Top Traders” visual will be our time series of “Trade Volume Over Time”. While we do not have a static version of this developed yet, it will display patterns of market-wide trade volume compared to trading activity from members of Congress. Additionally, we will add marks for important events that spurred major volatility and trading activity. The key takeaway from this visualization will be the edge Congress has in preempting these events, as its members often receive classified information before the American public. 
    Combined, we believe that these charts will give a full overview of how elected officials of the United States take advantage of their positions to outperform the stock market. This is a major are of contention and corruption that we hope to shine a light on with our visualizations.
