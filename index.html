    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
        This data visualization project deals with the controversy over
        stock trading in Congress which has been a hot topic over the past
        year or so. Members of Congress are required to publicly disclose
        any trades they make so as to not violate insider trading laws.
        However, much of this data is not easily readable by the average
        retail investor. <strong>The goal of the project is to present this
        information in the most transparent way possible to retail
        investors.</strong>

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

  <p>

     A user would use this dashboard to investigate how members of Congress trade with their heightened information. The tree map of
    popular investments could easily be compared to market-cap weighted S&P 500 holdings to see what Congress is abnormally invested in.
    If a user suspected elected officials invested in vaccine companies prior to mandate announcements, they could select “$PFE” in the map to
    show data on Pfizer below. From there, they would be able to confirm their hypothesis if the announcement for a mandate was given after
    Congress increased their trade volume in the stock and before the rest of the market did. The “Top Traders” would be a more specific
    detailing of who exactly is behind increased trading activity.
