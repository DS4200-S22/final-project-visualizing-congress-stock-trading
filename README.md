## Usage

The tool has already been created and can be viewed in the link above, no extra setup required. Upon loading the page (optimized for desktop), the user can navigate to the gray section of the landing page, this is where the tool lives. 

The user can easily see the 3 charts, and interact with all three. Simply start by picking a stock you would like to see specifics on.

## Organization

Overview of the files and folders provided in your repo.

### Root Files

* `README.md` is this explanatory file.

* `index.html` contains the main website HTML. 

* `style.css` contains CSS to style the website.

* `index.js` contains the D3 code to create the visualization. 

* `LICENCE` is the source code license for the template. You can add your name or leave it as is.

### Folders

* `data` will hold the data file(s) for your visualization tool.

* `files` will contain any files you link on your webpage such as screenshots, diagrams, presentation slide deck, video, and final report.

* `js` will contain all JavaScript files you write.   

* `lib` will contain any JavaScript library you use. It currently includes D3. To ensure long-term survivability, *use the included D3 here rather than linking to [d3js.org](https://d3js.org) or some other CDN.* Likewise, put your other libraries here rather than loading them from elsewhere.

After clicking on an energy stock, such as USAC, you can see the bar chart shows only republicans have made significant investment, and on something like DIS, an entertainment stock, the main traders are democrats. Users can make their own judgement but it would be easy to guess democrats stay away from energy and invest their money in things that would not damage their political image
